# Required for Figma MCP server (VS Code agent mode only, never used in deploys).
# Copy this file to .env and replace the placeholder with your real token.
#
# Generate a Figma Personal Access Token:
#   1. Log in to figma.com → click avatar → Settings → Security tab
#   2. Scroll to "Personal access tokens" → Generate new token
#   3. Name: "VS Code MCP" | Scope: "File content (Read-only)"
#   4. Copy the token immediately — it only displays once
#
# The .env file is gitignored — your key is never committed.
