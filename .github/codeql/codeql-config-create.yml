name: "SeventySix CodeQL Create Configuration"
# This file is used ONLY by `codeql database create --codescanning-config`.
#
# It contains ONLY the paths-ignore section. The `queries:` and `models:` keys from
# codeql-config.yml are GitHub-Actions-only directives — when passed to `database create`
# locally, they cause the CLI to try to resolve query suites at extraction time, fail with
# "Query pack csharp-security-and-quality cannot be found," and silently abort database
# creation while PowerShell continues executing, producing stale SARIF results.
#
# Queries are specified directly in the `codeql database analyze` command.
# Sanitizer models are applied via `--model-packs` in the analyze command.
# See run-codeql-scan.ps1 for the full pipeline.
