# Prettier should NOT format TypeScript/JavaScript files
# Formatting is handled by EditorConfig + ESLint instead
# This prevents Prettier from conflicting with our custom rules:
# - Binary operators (&&, ||, +, -, /, *) on LEFT side of new lines
# - Closing ) never on its own line (matches C# conventions)
*.ts
*.js

# But DO format these files with Prettier
!*.html
!*.scss
!*.css
!*.json
